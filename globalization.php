<p> I spent the summer of 2019 learning more about statistical programming with <a href="http://www.abshahid.com/" class="red">Abdullah Shahid</a>, 
quantitatively evaluating the emergence and spread of financial institutions to better understand globalization. </p>

<p> My work involved writing web parsing and scraping scripts in Python, compiling datasets from cleaned and formatted data based on various search queries, 
    preparing data visualizations from the data, and working with statistical packages to follow different research hypotheses.</p>
<p>  For confidentiality purposes, I cannot disclose further information about the project itself, but if you're interested in learning more about the process and methodology, please reach out and we can discuss!</p>

<p> My experience on this project was so informative and compelling, as I got hands-on experience in graduate level research and interdisciplinary computation.
    Most of all, I got to put a wide variety of different statistical packages and modelling methods into practice.
