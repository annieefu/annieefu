                    <p> I spent the summer of 2019 learning more about statistical programming with <a href="http://www.abshahid.com/" class="red">Abdullah Shahid</a> under <a href="https://sociology.cornell.edu/david-strang" class="red">Professor David Strang</a>,
                        quantitatively evaluating the emergence and spread of financial institutions to better understand globalization. </p>

                    <p> My experience on this project was so informative and compelling, as I got hands-on experience in graduate level research and interdisciplinary computation.
                        Most of all, I got to put a wide variety of different statistical packages and modelling methods into practice.
