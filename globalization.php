<p> I spent the summer of 2019 learning more about statistical programming with <a href="http://www.abshahid.com/" class="red">Abdullah Shahid</a> under <a href="https://sociology.cornell.edu/david-strang">Professor David Strang, 
quantitatively evaluating the emergence and spread of financial institutions to better understand globalization. </p>

<p class="halfspace"> My work involved writing web parsing and scraping scripts in Python, compiling datasets from cleaned and formatted data based on various search queries, 
    and generating data visualizations to pursue topical hypotheses.</p>
<p class="halfspace">  For confidentiality purposes, I cannot disclose further information about the project, but if you're interested in learning more about the process and methodology, please reach out and we can discuss!</p>

<p class="halfspace"> My experience on this project was so informative and compelling, as I got hands-on experience in graduate level research and interdisciplinary computation.
    Most of all, I got to put a wide variety of different statistical packages and modelling methods into practice.
