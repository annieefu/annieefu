          <p>This past fall, my team’s Human-Computer Interaction Design course challenged us to design for communities. 
            Our design needed to be both <strong>significant</strong> — improving the lives of those in our chosen community, and <strong>practical</strong> —
             meaning we needed direct access to individuals in our community in order to best design and evaluate our 
             product for them.</p>

Imagine you're an international student, excited because you just got off the waitlist to attend Cornell in the fall. It's already May, though,
and you need to find reliable, safe, comfortable housing and you don't know where to start. Cornell has some resources, but not many. It looks like it's all up to you.

        Cornell international students want to secure reliable, affordable housing that fits their needs. However, they cannot do that because:  <br><br>1)
         They don't have a single, complete platform that lists available units according to their preferences. </br><br>
         2) The leasing process is unfamiliar and opaque. They often get caught in exploitative housing relationships.</p></div>
