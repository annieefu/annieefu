<h2 class="blogpage-title special">First Blog Post: What I'm working on now, post-graduation</h2>
<div class="hero-blog bodybin"></br>
    <p>Before the pandemic began, I never considered graduating early: I thoroughly enjoy being a student, and even four years feels too short to relish all that college has to offer.
In October of 2020, however, three months into an entirely remote semester, I began to reconsider. I was juggling school, social life, <a href=“http://cornelldatajourn.al”>a campus publication</a>, and a <a href=“http://smartwires.com”>fast-paced internship</a> all at once, and found myself ready to bring my chapter of undergraduate academics to a close.
</br></br>
    So, I decided to graduate early. Four months later, I can say with complete certainty that this was the right decision. I haven’t stopped learning—as a Teaching Assistant, Research Assistant, and club president, I’m engaging with new concepts, diverse groups of peers, and learning more than ever. Exercising leadership and applying skills has deepened my appreciation for my education and opened my eyes to new career paths of interest. I also spend my time with more intentionality now that I have full control over my tasks and deadlines.
</br></br>
As a result, I now have a delicious plate of commitments I’m indulging in day to day. I’ve also decided to pursue a career in <b>data journalism</b>, a field I only began learning about in the spring. My typical workday this semester now consists of coordinating Cornell Data Journal events, research reviews and iteration, and dabbling in one or two personal projects a day.
Most of these are semester-long pieces for publication in May, so I thought I'd reflect on my progress so far and give a preview of what's coming next.
</br></br>
<ol></br>
<li> <b>The Panter Family Tree </b> </br></br>After her father passed away in December, my friend Dara revealed to me that she and her cousin had been uncovering their family ancestry for almost a year. She planned to eventually organize everything into a comprehensive family tree, and asked if I knew any tools to help her do so. I immediately leaped at the opportunity to collaborate with her in coding an interactive family tree visualization in D3.js, powered by a json data file for easy editing and updating.
</br></br>

</br></br>

This project has brought up plenty of interesting design decisions so far, including how to organize the nodes themselves and present information in a concise way, so as to not overwhelm the viewer. Along the way, I’ve heard plenty of heartwarming anecdotes about Dara’s family, as well as some tragic history on family members who were killed in the Holocaust. Overall, I’m grateful to be creating something with so much historical and personal value for a dear friend of mine, while learning new visualization techniques along the way.
I'm looking forward to adding the complete set of nodes once the complicated ties between everyone are sorted out.

<li><b> Tent Cities </b></br></br>
My friend Dana hails from Charlotte, North Carolina, and over our winter break from school, 
she took note of a growing tent city beneath a freeway overpass. The tent city has been there for years, but due to the pandemic,
seemed more sprawling than ever before.</br></br>


<img src="images/blog-images/bp1/bp1-2.png" class="blog-img" width="200rem"></br></br>
In our preliminary research for a blog post related to Charlotte, we generated this line graph of the tent city population 
over time, showing peaks in February 2020 and December 2020 and a low in January 2020, when the area was razed.</br></br>


Our project for the publication Cornell Data Journal this semester will
expand this topic into tent cities in three cities: Ithaca, New York; New York City, New York; and Portland, Oregon.
Starting with Charlotte as a first exploration has introduced us to broader concepts related to homelessness, including
contributing factors of high tax rates, high rent rates, and costs of childcare. </br></br>
Skills-wise, reaching out to sources in our 
native collegetown of Ithaca for this project has led to connections at our fellow Ithaca College, which have been extremely fruitful
in discussing local history and government. We've also had several discussions on reporting ethics 
</li></br>

<li> <b>Visualizing Pathways at the Future of Learning Lab </b></br></br>
As a larger-scale research project, I've had the opportunity to delve into educational innovation research through the Future of Learning Lab at Cornell. 
Working cross-functionally with the UX and development teams has not only challenged me to rapidly pick up React, but 
also immersed me in a real-world environment of product management.</br>


<img src="images/blog-images/bp1/bp1-3.png" class="blog-img" width="200rem"></br>
The tool is in V1 development stage, and seeing the working product come out of the woodwork from user research and Figma prototypes
has been both rewarding and nervewracking, knowing our users will finally be able to try out the tool for themselves so soon.
</li>
</ol></br>
<p>Between these three projects, I've been pretty happy to have my brain pulled in multiple different directions each week, exercising different skills 
    and interfacing with different teams. More updates to come, and thanks for reading!
