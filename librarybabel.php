              Establishing that our library wanted to convey a sense of time converging in one spacial experience, we decided to <strong> split our design

<p>I've never consulted the internet for more resources or information than I did with this project. I learned <strong> immense gratitude for the Information Age!!</strong>
  For a project that in part reminisces about the pre-technological age of print media, this is <strong>a bold statement, literally.</strong>

          <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
<p>Designing and developing in Virtual Reality for the first time brought a steep learning curve, which calls for copious user testing. 
  We would debug one feature and <strong>test three times</strong>, in keyboard-control player mode, on the Oculus Headset, and on the Valve headset.
Each test would highlight new issues, and <strong>sometimes solving an issue in one headset would cause a problem in the other.</strong>
We needed to make compromises for the sake of compatability.

          <p>In other UX design situations, interactions and design changes are more black and white;
            either they work the way the designer intends, or they don't.
            <strong>Environmental UX design, however, involves countless metrics contributing to a smooth user experience.
</strong> Scaling, interaction, and lighting all worked in a more nuanced way in VR than
we imagined, and lots of our debugging revolved around <strong>making items appear and interact naturally/comfortably within their built environment.</strong>

<p>We experienced a couple painful times the <strong>consequences of developing too many features at once</strong>, facing a bug, and not knowing what feature was causing the problem.
  By the end of the process, we were saving and testing after even the slightest changes, and though tedious, it saved us a lot of time towards the end.
