          <p>Our professor challenged us to design a virtual reality experience that <strong>organically displayed a collection of 
              3D Models</strong> we had rendered in previous assignments, including a hollowed log of petrified wood. The virtual space needed to
              allow users to see the models from any angle and interact with their contents in a meaningful way.</div>

          <p>A vast field is filled with wildlife and covered by a starry night sky. People lie scattered on their backs, resting, stargazing and dreaming. The walker can approach
              these people and indulge in their daydreams by approaching them at rest.

          <p>Playing on the increasingly immersive quality of social media, we create an interactive media environment where the walker can "step into" tagged destinations and view posted videos with a 360 effect.</p><br>

          <p>We decided to pursue <strong>option three,</strong> since it excited us the most, contained more flexibility for implementing interactivity, and sparked thought of how media will progress past the status quo.</div>

    <q> The library will endure; it is the universe. As for us, everything has not been written; we are not turning into phantoms. 
      We walk the corridors, searching the shelves and rearranging them, looking for lines of 
      meaning amid leagues of cacophony and incoherence, reading the history of the past and our future, 
      collecting our thoughts and collecting the thoughts of others, and every so often glimpsing mirrors, 
      in which we may recognize creatures of the information.</q><p class="text-right author"> - Jorge Luis Borges, <em>The Library of Babel</em></p>

Establishing that our library wanted to convey a sense of time converging in one spacial experience, we decided to split our design
into three different areas, each representing a different era of media and technology. The walker travels freely through each of the realms and 
interacts meaningfully with the artifacts of each era, from print media to television displays to cloud-computing data structures.
